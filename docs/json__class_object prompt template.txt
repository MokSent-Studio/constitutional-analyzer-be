You are a Senior Python Developer specializing in API and Data Modeling. Your task is to create a Python data class that serves as a robust, type-safe data structure for deserializing a JSON object.

**Technical Requirements:**
1.  Use the `dataclasses` module for a concise and modern class definition.
2.  Use the `Enum` class from the `enum` module to strictly define the allowed values for `explanationScope`. This is critical for data integrity.
3.  Use the `typing` module for all type hints (`str`, `List`, `Optional`).
4.  The class should be named `AnalysisRequest`.
5.  The field names in the class must use Python's standard `snake_case` (e.g., `chapter_url`).

**JSON Schema to Model:**
-   `chapterUrl` (string, required)
-   `analysisRole` (string, optional, default: "Constitutional Law Professor")
-   `explanationScope` (string, required, one of "A", "B", or "C")
-   `targetAudience` (string, optional)
-   `followUpQuestions` (array of strings, optional, default: empty list)

**Strict Output Requirements:**
-   The output MUST be a single, complete Python code block.
-   Include all necessary imports.
-   Do not include any explanatory text before or after the code block.
